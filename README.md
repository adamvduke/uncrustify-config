uncrustify-config
===========

My personal preference for formatting Objective-C codez is [uncrustify](http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net/).

Uncrustify has a large number of configuration options.

The file uncrustify.conf contains a set of configuration options that make Objective-C code pretty to read, but may not fit your personal prefernce. Feel free to modify as necessary.
